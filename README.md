Ring-LWE Encryption
========
This repository contains source code to perform Ring-LWE encryption for two different parameter sets, one providing 128-bit security and the other providing 256-bit security.


The code in this repository is based on the research paper entitled "Efficient Software Implementation of Ring-LWE", available at https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/725.pdf.
