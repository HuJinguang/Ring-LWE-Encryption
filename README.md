Ring-LWE Encryption
========
This repository contains source code to perform post-quantum cryptography based on the Ring-LWE problem. It can perform encryption for two different parameter sets, one providing 128-bit security and the other providing 256-bit security.

Post-Quantum Cryptography
=========
Present day public-key schemes rely on the difficulty of performing factoring or the discrete logarithm for providing security, authenticity and privacy. For sufficiently large key sizes, these public-key cyptosystems are practically unsolvable
using present day computers or even using super computers or special hardware clusters. Peter Shor has proposed a quantum algorithm for integer factorization, and this algorithm has been modified to be able to solve the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). Shorâ€™s algorithms only runs on powerful quantum computers to solve the factoring or the discrete logarithm problems in polynomial time.

Supported Parameters Sets
==========
This project supports two security parameter sets.

The 128-bit security parameter set: n=256, q=7681, sigma=11.31/sqrrt(2*pi)

The 256-bit security parameter set: n=512, q=12289, sigma=12.18/sqrrt(2*pi)
